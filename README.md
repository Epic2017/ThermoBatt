# Introduction
For decades, the primary focus in battery health assessment has been on metrics such as voltage levels and current flow. However, ThermoBatt shifts the lens towards the thermal attributes, a domain less explored but equally vital. ThermoBatt encompasses two innovative models: the first, a machine learning algorithm, predicts the State of Health (SOH) and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of batteries by analyzing factors such as ambient temperature and usage cycles. The second, a real-time temperature distribution model, utilizes temperature data within charge/discharge cycles to simulate thermal behavior. This approach necessitates several assumptions, underscoring the pioneering nature of our exploration. ThermoBatt aims to deepen our understanding of how heat generation and distribution influence battery health and longevity. By bridging this knowledge gap, our work illuminates the interconnectedness of thermal dynamics with battery efficiency and endurance, paving the way for advancements in battery technology and sustainable energy solutions."

# Temperature Distribution Model:
The temperature distribution model within the ThermoBatt project is a sophisticated tool designed to vividly illustrate the spread and distribution of heat across a battery over time. Utilizing a grid-based framework, this model simulates the battery's surface, where each cell in the grid represents a specific area on the battery. As the simulation progresses, these cells change color to reflect real-time temperature variations, effectively visualizing the dynamic process of heat generation, spread, and dissipation during charge/discharge cycles. This detailed portrayal not only highlights areas of concentrated heat but also shows how thermal energy moves across the battery, providing critical insights into the thermal management of battery systems.

# Machine Learning Model for SOH and RUL Prediction:
The second cornerstone of ThermoBatt is its machine learning model, adept at predicting the State of Health (SOH) and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of batteries. Relying on user-input parameters such as ambient temperature and number of usage cycles, this algorithm can forecast battery health indicators with remarkable accuracy. It stands as an exemplar of utilizing machine learning to interpret complex relationships between various factors affecting battery performance and lifespan.

# Important Points:
Central to ThermoBatt's functionality is its use of the NASA Battery Dataset from the Prognostics Center of Excellence. Specifically, the project currently analyzes Battery ID 'B0005' from this dataset, demonstrating the practical application of the models. However, the architecture of ThermoBatt is designed to be universally applicable to other batteries within the dataset, showcasing its versatility. 

The array-based data structure is pivotal for both models, facilitating the detailed graphing of temperature distribution and battery health metrics. Automatic screenshot capture enhances the user experience by allowing for the documentation of specific states throughout the simulation.

# Future Outlook:
The future of ThermoBatt is ambitious and promising. Plans are underway to incorporate data from experiments on other batteries within the NASA dataset, aiming to develop a more complex and comprehensive model. This expansion will enable ThermoBatt to cater to a wider range of battery types and conditions, enhancing its applicability and accuracy. Additionally, there is an exciting prospect of integrating Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to model natural airflow around batteries. This advancement will allow for a more effective simulation of convective heat loss, thereby enriching the model's capability to accurately represent real-world thermal behavior in battery systems. These developments are expected to significantly elevate ThermoBatt's status as an essential tool for battery health analysis and thermal management research.
